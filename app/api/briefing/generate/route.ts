Write in formal, objective language and structure the briefing exactly like the historical document format with:

CRITICAL: This is an educational simulation for ${severityLevel} severity conflict. Response must be PROPORTIONAL to threat level:
- LOW severity (trade disputes, economic issues): Diplomatic and economic responses ONLY - NO military action
- MEDIUM severity (military buildups, cyber attacks): Defensive readiness with diplomatic pressure
- HIGH/EXTREME severity (attacks on citizens, territorial invasion): Military action appropriate

SEVERITY CHECK: For ${severityLevel} conflicts, only recommend military action if it matches what governments actually do for THIS threat level. Trade embargos do not warrant military deployment.

1. A date header
2. "Proposed plan of action for ${scenario}" followed by "in the light of:" and points (a), (b), (c), (d) - each point should be specific to the current conflict scenario
3. A concluding assessment paragraph that synthesizes the specific situation between ${offensiveCountry} and ${defensiveCountry} and its implications for ${selectedCountry}
4. "Therefore it seems to me that more decisive action may be indicated than any heretofore considered regarding the ${offensiveCountry}-${defensiveCountry} situation, and should be patterned along the following lines:" paragraph
5. Numbered recommendations (1), (2), (3), (4) - THESE MUST BE PROPORTIONAL TO ${severityLevel} SEVERITY:
   - LOW: Diplomatic channels, economic countermeasures, legal remedies
   - MEDIUM: Defensive preparations with diplomatic pressure  
   - HIGH/EXTREME: Military action, economic warfare, decisive responses
6. A final recommendation paragraph explaining which of the 4 options you specifically recommend for ${selectedCountry} and why
7. Classification and author signature

CRITICAL: Make all content PROPORTIONAL to ${severityLevel} severity. Only recommend military action for HIGH/EXTREME threats where lives, territory, or sovereignty are threatened. Trade disputes and economic issues require diplomatic and economic responses, not military deployment.

SPECIFICITY REQUIREMENTS - NO PLACEHOLDER BRACKETS:
LOW SEVERITY - Diplomatic/Economic Details:
- Treaties: UN Charter articles, WTO agreements, EU Treaty provisions
- Bodies: UN Security Council procedures, WTO Dispute Settlement mechanisms
- Economic: GATT articles, sanctions frameworks, specific asset amounts

MEDIUM SEVERITY - Defensive/Alliance Details:
- Military: AMX-56 Leclerc tanks, Rafale squadrons, FREMM frigates
- Bases: Istres Air Base, Avord Air Base, Solenzara Air Base
- Alliances: NATO Article 4, EU Article 42.7, bilateral defense treaties

HIGH/EXTREME SEVERITY - Military/Operational Details:
- Weapons: SCALP missiles, Rafale jets, FREMM frigates
- Targets: ACTUAL naval bases (Qingdao, Dalian), coordinates (16Â°N 114Â°E)
- Straits: Strait of Malacca, Taiwan Strait, Bosphorus
- Assets: REAL amounts (â‚¬50 billion, â‚¬200 billion)
- Units: 1st RPIMa, specific squadrons, carrier groups

CRITICAL: Generate ACTUAL locations and amounts tailored to ${selectedCountry} - NOT brackets. Use ${selectedCountry}'s specific military equipment and alliances:
- USA: F-35 fighters, Tomahawk missiles, USS carriers, NATO Article 5, ANZUS
- France: Rafale jets, SCALP missiles, Charles de Gaulle carrier, NATO Article 5, EU Article 42.7
- UK: Typhoon fighters, Storm Shadow missiles, HMS carriers, NATO Article 5, Five Eyes
- Germany: Leopard 2 tanks, Tornado jets, NATO Article 5, EU Article 42.7
- India: Su-30MKI fighters, BrahMos missiles, INS carriers, Quad Alliance
- China: J-20 fighters, DF missiles, PLAN carriers, Shanghai Cooperation
