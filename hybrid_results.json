Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) (1968): This is the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. It aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology, promote disarmament, and facilitate the peaceful use of nuclear energy. As of now, 191 parties have joined the NPT, making it the most widely adhered-to arms control treaty.\n\n2. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) (2017): This treaty is a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, including their possession and testing. It was adopted in 2017 and entered into force in 2021 with 94 parties. It is the first legally binding international agreement to comprehensively prohibit nuclear weapons with the goal of leading towards their total elimination.\n\n3. Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) (1996): This treaty bans all nuclear explosions for both civilian and military purposes. It has been signed by 187 states and ratified by 178, but it has not yet entered into force. The treaty also establishes a global verification regime to monitor compliance.\n\n4. Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967): This treaty established Latin America and the Caribbean as a nuclear-weapon-free zone. It has been ratified by all 33 countries in the region.\n\n5. Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963): This treaty bans nuclear tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, and underwater. It has been signed by 126 parties.\n\nThese treaties collectively form the backbone of the international nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament regime. They aim to limit the spread of nuclear weapons, promote disarmament, and ensure the peaceful use of nuclear energy. They also provide a framework for international cooperation and dialogue on nuclear issues.","retrievedContext":["Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT): Adopted 1968, entered into force 1970; Parties: 191; Description: Prevents spread of nuclear weapons, promotes disarmament and peaceful use.","Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW): Adopted 2017, entered into force 2021; Parties: 94; Description: Comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons, including possession and testing.","Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT): Adopted 1996, not yet in force but provisionally applied; Parties: 187 signed, 178 ratified; Description: Bans all nuclear explosions; monitoring system operational.","Treaty of Tlatelolco (Latin America Nuclear-Free Zone): 1967; Parties: 33; Description: Prohibits nuclear weapons in region.","Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: 1963; Parties: 126; Description: Bans nuclear tests in atmosphere, space, underwater.","Arms Trade Treaty (ATT): Adopted 2013, entered into force 2014; Parties: 115; Description: Regulates international trade in conventional arms to prevent illicit flows.","Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity: Adopted 26 November 1968, entered into force 11 November 1970; Parties: 55; Description: Prevents time bars for prosecuting war crimes.","Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties: Adopted 23 August 1978, entered into force 6 November 1996; Parties: 23; Description: Rules for treaty continuity when states succeed others."]},{"question":"How have territorial disputes been resolved historically through treaties?","metrics":{"faithfulness":1,"answerRelevancy":1,"contextPrecision":0,"contextRecall":0},"response":"Historically, territorial disputes have been resolved through various treaties that provide mechanisms for peaceful resolution of disputes. \n\nOne of the most notable examples is the Paris Peace Treaties of 1947, which ended World War II in Europe and involved significant border adjustments. This treaty is still relevant for current boundaries and serves as a historical precedent for resolving territorial disputes through diplomatic negotiations and agreements.\n\nAnother important treaty is the Revised General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, adopted in 1949. This treaty provides mechanisms like arbitration and conciliation for peaceful resolution of disputes, including territorial disputes. It is still in force and can be used as a tool for resolving current territorial disputes.\n\nThe Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), adopted in 1945, also plays a significant role in resolving territorial disputes. As an integral part of the UN Charter, it governs the ICJ's organization, jurisdiction, and procedures for settling international disputes. The ICJ has been instrumental in resolving numerous territorial disputes between countries.\n\nThe Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes, adopted in 1963, provides another mechanism for dispute resolution. It allows for the ICJ settlement of consular disputes, which can include territorial disputes.\n\nIn the modern context, these treaties provide a framework for resolving territorial disputes in a peaceful and orderly manner. Policymakers can use these treaties as tools for negotiation and dispute resolution, and they can also serve as a basis for developing new treaties and agreements to address current territorial disputes.","retrievedContext":["Paris Peace Treaties (1947): 1947; Parties: Allies + Axis (Italy, etc.); Description: Ended WWII in Europe, border adjustments (parts still relevant for boundaries).","Ukraine-Russia Negotiations (ongoing 2025): Proposed deals involving territorial concessions, NATO neutrality; no final agreement but talks active under Trump admin.","Revised General Act for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes: Adopted 28 April 1949, entered into force 20 September 1950; Parties: 9; Description: Provides mechanisms like arbitration and conciliation for peaceful resolution of disputes.","Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of Treaties: Adopted 23 August 1978, entered into force 6 November 1996; Parties: 23; Description: Rules for treaty continuity when states succeed others.","UN Charter (as peace framework): 1945; Parties: 193; Description: Prevents war through collective security.","Statute of the International Court of Justice: Adopted 26 June 1945, entered into force 24 October 1945; Parties: 193; Description: Integral part of UN Charter, governs the ICJ's organization, jurisdiction, and procedures for settling international disputes.","Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes: Adopted 24 April 1963, entered into force 19 March 1967; Parties: 52; Description: ICJ settlement for consular disputes.","Optional Protocol to the Convention on Special Missions concerning the Compulsory Settlement of Disputes: Adopted 8 December 1969, not yet in force; Parties: N/A (insufficient ratifications); Description: Would mandate dispute settlement but not applicable due to non-entry."]},{"question":"What are the key diplomatic immunity treaties?","metrics":{"faithfulness":1,"answerRelevancy":1,"contextPrecision":0.375,"contextRecall":1},"response":"The key diplomatic immunity treaties are:\n\n1.

United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (1992): This treaty was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994. It was the first international treaty to explicitly address climate change and aimed to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. The treaty recognized that the climate system is a shared resource and that emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere's composition.\n\n2. Kyoto Protocol (1997): This treaty was adopted in 1997 and entered into force in 2005. It was an extension of the UNFCCC and set binding emission reduction targets for developed countries. Although the Kyoto Protocol has expired, it significantly influenced the development of subsequent climate change treaties, particularly the Paris Agreement.\n\n3. Paris Agreement (2015): This treaty was adopted in 2015 and entered into force in 2016. It aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C, preferably to 1.5°C, compared to pre-industrial levels. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol, which set top-down emission reduction targets, the Paris Agreement allows countries to set their own nationally determined contributions to emission reduction.\n\nThese treaties represent the evolution of international efforts to address climate change. The UNFCCC established the framework for international cooperation on climate change. The Kyoto Protocol introduced legally binding emission reduction targets for developed countries. The Paris Agreement expanded this approach by including all countries and allowing them to set their own emission reduction targets. These treaties remain relevant today as the international community continues to grapple with the challenge of climate change.","retrievedContext":["United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC): Adopted 1992, entered into force 1994; Parties: 198; Description: Stabilizes greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent dangerous climate interference.","Kyoto Protocol: Adopted 1997, entered into force 2005; Parties: 192; Description: Sets binding emission reduction targets for developed countries (expired but influenced Paris).","Paris Agreement: Adopted 2015, entered into force 2016; Parties: 195; Description: Aims to limit global warming to below 2°C; nationally determined contributions.","Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer: Adopted 1987, entered into force 1989; Parties: 198; Description: Phases out production of ozone-depleting substances; universal ratification.","Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer: Adopted 1985, entered into force 1988; Parties: 198; Description: Framework for protecting the ozone layer from depletion.","Minamata Convention on Mercury: Adopted 2013, entered into force 2017; Parties: 143; Description: Reduces mercury emissions and use.","Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants: Adopted 2001, entered into force 2004; Parties: 186; Description: Eliminates or restricts POPs like DDT.","US-Peru FTA: 2009; Parties: 2; Description: Environmental protections included."]},{"question":"How do trade agreements resolve commercial disputes?","metrics":{"faithfulness":0,"answerRelevancy":1,"contextPrecision":0.125,"contextRecall":0.5},"response":"Trade agreements often include provisions for resolving commercial disputes. These provisions typically establish a framework for dispute resolution that can include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation. The goal is to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving disputes that arise under the agreement.\n\nFor example, the World Trade Organization Agreements (Marrakesh Agreement) adopted in 1994 and entered into force in 1995, established the World Trade Organization (WTO), which has a well-defined dispute resolution process. The WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) provides a forum for member states to resolve trade disputes. The DSU process involves consultations, panel proceedings, and potential appeal to the Appellate Body. The WTO's dispute resolution process is considered one of the most active and influential international dispute resolution bodies.\n\nSimilarly, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), adopted in 2020 and entered into force in 2022, also includes provisions for dispute resolution. The RCEP is the world's largest trade bloc, covering the Asia-Pacific region, and its dispute resolution mechanism is expected to play a significant role in resolving trade disputes in the region.\n\nIn the context of bilateral trade agreements, such as the US-Singapore FTA (2004), dispute resolution mechanisms are also typically included. These mechanisms can vary depending on the specific agreement but often involve some form of arbitration or mediation.\n\nIn conclusion, trade agreements resolve commercial disputes by providing a structured process for dispute resolution, which can include negotiation, mediation, arbitration, or litigation. These mechanisms provide a way for parties to resolve their disputes in a fair and efficient manner, thereby promoting stability and predictability in international trade. Policymakers should consider the effectiveness of these mechanisms when negotiating and implementing trade agreements.","retrievedContext":["World Trade Organization Agreements (Marrakesh Agreement): Adopted 1994, entered into force 1995; Parties: 164; Description: Establishes WTO, reduces trade barriers in goods, services, IP.","EU-Mercosur Trade Agreement: Provisionally in force 2024 (full 2025); Parties: EU + 4 Mercosur; Description: Reduces tariffs between EU and South American bloc.","African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA): Adopted 2018, entered into force 2019; Parties: 54; Description: Creates single African market, boosts intra-African trade.","Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): Adopted 2020, entered into force 2022; Parties: 15; Description: World's largest trade bloc, covering Asia-Pacific, eases trade rules.","US-Oman FTA: 2009; Parties: 2; Description: Liberalizes trade, IP standards.","US-Costa Rica (via CAFTA-DR): 2009; Parties: Multiple; Description: Central American trade integration.","US-Panama FTA: 2012; Parties: 2; Description: Canal-related trade benefits.","US-Singapore FTA: 2004; Parties: 2; Description: Services and digital trade focus."]}]},"timestamp":"2025-08-04T21:43:30.789Z"}
