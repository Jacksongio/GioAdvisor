SITUATION: ${context.scenario}
SEVERITY: ${context.severityLevel}
LEGAL FRAMEWORK:
${treatyContext}

Response prioritization based on severity:
- HIGH/EXTREME severity (attacks on citizens, territorial invasion, major military aggression): Lead with immediate military responses, economic warfare, retaliation
- MEDIUM severity (military buildups, cyber attacks, proxy conflicts): Military readiness, targeted sanctions, defensive positioning
- LOW severity (trade disputes, diplomatic tensions, economic embargos): Diplomatic pressure, economic countermeasures, legal remedies - NO MILITARY ACTION

CRITICAL SEVERITY CHECK: For ${context.severityLevel} severity:
- If LOW severity: Focus on diplomatic, economic, and legal responses. Military action is NOT appropriate for trade disputes or economic issues
- If MEDIUM severity: Include defensive military preparations alongside diplomatic efforts
- If HIGH/EXTREME severity: Military action and immediate retaliation are appropriate

Generate options that:
1. Are PROPORTIONAL to the actual threat level - no military deployment for trade issues
2. Match what nations actually do for THIS specific severity level
3. Include SPECIFIC details with ACTUAL VALUES:
   - Military: Exact weapon systems (SCALP, MICA missiles), vehicles (Leclerc tanks, Rafale jets), bases (Istres, Solenzara), REAL coordinates (16¬∞N 114¬∞E)
   - Targets: ACTUAL naval bases (Qingdao, Dalian, Vladivostok), ports, strategic straits (Malacca, Taiwan)
   - Diplomatic: Specific treaty articles (UN Charter Art. 2(3), NATO Art. 5), alliance mechanisms, international bodies
   - Economic: REAL asset amounts (‚Ç¨50 billion, ‚Ç¨200 billion), specific sanctions frameworks
   - NO PLACEHOLDER BRACKETS: Never use [SPECIFIC PORTS], [AMOUNT], [COORDINATES] - provide actual values

CRITICAL: For ${context.selectedCountry}, ONLY use equipment, bases, and alliances from their specific section above. NEVER use generic terms or equipment from other countries.

MANDATORY FAILSAFE FOR UNLISTED COUNTRIES:
If ${context.selectedCountry} is NOT listed in the database above, you MUST COMPLETELY REPLACE the standard military recommendations with country-specific realistic actions based on their actual capabilities and relationships.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You MUST use EXACT equipment names from the ${context.selectedCountry} database above. 

MANDATORY CHECK: Is ${context.selectedCountry} in the military assets database above?

IF FOUND IN DATABASE: Use exact equipment from their database section
- Must contain 2-3 specific equipment names, bases, alliance articles
- Follow normal military recommendation template

IF NOT FOUND IN DATABASE: COMPLETELY ABANDON the standard template
- DO NOT use any of the standard recommendation templates 
- DO NOT mention "[Country]-specific weapons systems" or "[Country] naval forces"
- INSTEAD: Create 4 entirely new recommendations based on their ACTUAL capabilities
- Research their real alliances, protector countries, and leverage points

EXAMPLES OF TEMPLATE ABANDONMENT:
‚ùå WRONG (Standard template): "Launch Cayman Islands-specific weapons systems against Luxembourg targets"
‚úÖ CORRECT (Country-specific): "Activate Cayman Islands Crisis Management Committee and request UK Foreign Office consultation under 2009 Constitution Order"

‚ùå WRONG (Standard template): "Deploy Monaco naval/carrier groups" 
‚úÖ CORRECT (Country-specific): "Request French military protection under 1861 Treaty of Franco-Mon√©gasque Friendship"

FORBIDDEN FOR SMALL COUNTRIES:
- Any mention of their non-existent military assets
- Standard military recommendation templates
- Generic "[Country]-specific" terminology
- Impossible actions like naval blockades by landlocked countries

REQUIRED FOR SMALL COUNTRIES:
- Specific constitutional/treaty references
- Named international organizations they belong to
- Actual government agencies they have
- Real diplomatic relationships and protection agreements

Generate ONLY the specific recommendation content for ${context.severityLevel} severity - do not include the template prefixes like "Primary response action [country] should take regarding...". Output direct, actionable recommendations.

CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR UNIQUE RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. VARY YOUR APPROACH: Don't use the same structure every time. Mix different strategic priorities:
   - Sometimes lead with intelligence gathering, other times with alliance coordination
   - Alternate between offensive and defensive postures based on scenario
   - Consider unconventional approaches like cyber warfare, economic leverage, or diplomatic pressure

2. ADAPT TO ANY COUNTRY: The recommendations must work for ALL countries, not just major powers:
   - Small countries: Focus on alliance protection, diplomatic channels, economic leverage
   - Island nations: Emphasize maritime security, international law, regional partnerships  
   - Landlocked countries: Focus on land-based assets, regional cooperation, trade routes
   - Financial centers: Leverage banking systems, sanctions, regulatory frameworks

3. USE SPECIFIC DETAILS: Always include concrete, real-world specifics:
   - Equipment: Use actual names from the military database above when available
   - Locations: Reference real bases, ports, straits, and geographic features
   - Treaties: Cite specific articles, mechanisms, and procedures
   - Organizations: Name actual UN bodies, regional groups, and alliances

4. ENSURE UNIQUENESS: Each recommendation should be distinct:
   - Don't repeat the same strategic approach across all four recommendations
   - Vary the scope (tactical vs strategic, immediate vs long-term)
   - Mix different domains (diplomatic, military, economic, intelligence, cyber)
   - Consider different escalation levels within the same severity category

5. PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE: Match the response to threat severity:
   - LOW: Diplomatic protests, economic measures, legal challenges, monitoring
   - MEDIUM: Defensive preparations, alliance consultations, targeted sanctions, deterrence
   - HIGH/EXTREME: Military action, comprehensive sanctions, alliance activation, direct retaliation

EXAMPLES OF UNIQUE APPROACHES:
- "Coordinate with [specific allies] to establish joint intelligence sharing on [specific threat]"
- "Deploy [specific assets] to [actual location] while maintaining diplomatic channels through [specific organization]"
- "Implement targeted sanctions through [specific regulatory framework] while preparing [specific military units] for defensive operations"
- "Leverage [country's unique strength] to build coalition support through [specific international mechanism]"
