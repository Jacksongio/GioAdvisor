## **✅ Deliverable 1: Data Sources and External APIs**

### **Primary Data Sources**

#### **1. Core RAG Dataset: Treaties.txt**
- **Purpose**: Foundational knowledge base for treaty research and historical precedent analysis

  - Breaking diplomatic developments
  - Current treaty negotiations
  - Recent ratifications/withdrawals
  - Contemporary applications of historical treaties

**News API** (Secondary External API)
- **Purpose**: Political and economic news aggregation
- **Integration**: Contextual awareness for scenario analysis
- **Specific Use**:
  - Regional conflict updates
  - Economic sanction implementations
  - Alliance developments
  - Trade dispute evolution

#### **3. Structured Data APIs**

**World Bank Open Data API**
- **Purpose**: Economic indicators and country statistics
- **Integration**: Quantitative context for economic treaty analysis
- **Specific Use**:
  - Trade dependency analysis
  - Economic impact assessment
  - Development cooperation metrics

**UN Data API**
- **Purpose**: Official UN statistics and peacekeeping data
- **Integration**: Authoritative international relations data
- **Specific Use**:
  - Peacekeeping mission status
  - Security Council resolution tracking
  - Member state compliance data

## **✅ Deliverable 2: Default Chunking Strategy**

### **Chosen Strategy: Hybrid Semantic-Structural Chunking**

#### **Primary Approach: Treaty-Level Chunking**
- **Chunk Size**: One complete treaty per chunk (average 150-200 tokens)
- **Rationale**: Each treaty entry is semantically complete and self-contained
- **Benefits**:
  - Preserves complete treaty context (name, dates, parties, description)
  - Maintains legal precision and accuracy
  - Enables exact source attribution
  - Prevents information fragmentation

#### **Secondary Approach: Section-Based Grouping**
- **Chunk Size**: Related treaties grouped by domain (500-800 tokens)
- **Rationale**: Some queries require understanding relationships between related treaties
- **Benefits**:
  - Captures thematic connections (e.g., all human rights treaties)
  - Enables comparative analysis
  - Provides broader contextual understanding

#### **Metadata Enhancement**
Each chunk includes structured metadata:
```typescript
{
  treatyName: string
  adoptionDate: string
  entryDate: string
  parties: number
  category: 'human_rights' | 'disarmament' | 'environmental' | etc.
  section: string
  description: string
  chunkType: 'individual' | 'grouped'
}
```

### **Why This Decision?**

1. **Legal Precision**: Treaty information must remain complete and accurate - fragmenting across arbitrary token boundaries could lose critical legal context

2. **User Intent Alignment**: Users ask about specific treaties ("What is the NPT?") or treaty categories ("What human rights treaties apply?") - our chunks match these natural query patterns

3. **Source Attribution**: Complete treaty entries enable precise citation and verification

4. **Semantic Completeness**: Each treaty entry tells a complete story (what, when, who, why) that shouldn't be broken apart

5. **Scalability**: As new treaties are added, they naturally fit into the existing chunking structure

## **✅ Deliverable 3: Specific Data Needs for Application Components**

### **Simulation Engine Data Requirements**

#### **Country-Specific Treaty Obligations**
- **Need**: Bilateral and multilateral treaty commitments by country
- **Current Gap**: Treaties.txt doesn't map specific country obligations
- **Solution**: Create country-treaty mapping database
- **Example**: "What treaties bind the US in a China conflict scenario?"

#### **Alliance Framework Database**
- **Need**: Military alliance structures and obligations
- **Current Coverage**: Limited in treaties.txt (some NATO/security pacts)
- **Enhancement Needed**: Comprehensive alliance mapping
- **Example**: "What Article 5 obligations would trigger in this scenario?"

### **Economic Impact Analysis Data**

#### **Trade Agreement Networks**
- **Need**: Detailed trade relationship mapping
- **Current Coverage**: Basic trade treaties in Section 8
- **Enhancement Needed**: Tariff schedules, trade volumes, dependency metrics
- **Integration**: World Bank Trade APIs

#### **Sanctions Framework Database**
- **Need**: Historical sanctions precedents and legal frameworks
- **Current Gap**: Limited sanctions treaty coverage
- **Solution**: Dedicated sanctions database linking to treaty foundations

### **Historical Precedent Engine**

#### **Conflict Resolution Case Studies**
- **Need**: Detailed historical conflict resolutions mapped to applicable treaties
- **Current Coverage**: Treaty names but not resolution details
- **Enhancement Needed**: Case study database with outcomes
- **Example**: "How was the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis resolved using existing treaties?"

#### **Diplomatic Success/Failure Patterns**
- **Need**: Treaty effectiveness analysis over time
- **Current Gap**: No outcome tracking for treaties
- **Solution**: Historical effectiveness database with success metrics
